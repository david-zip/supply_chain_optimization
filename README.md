# MSc Research Project 

## Overview
Python code to reinforcement learning for supply chain optimization using stochasitc serach algorithms.

Supply chain environment consist of single raw material, single product, waiting time stochasicity, and echelon flexibility.

## Algorithms implemented:
- [x] Simulated Annealing (SA)
- [x] Asynchronous Parallel Simulated Annealing (PSA)
- [x] Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- [x] Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)
- [x] Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- [x] Vanilla Evolutionary Strategy (ES)
- [ ] Covariate-Martix-Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES)
- [ ] Natural Evolutionary Strategy (NES)
- [x] Differential Evolution (DE)
- [ ] REINFORCE 
- [ ] Actor-Critic (AC)

## Tasks
- [x] refactor training file
- [x] add constraint bounds to PSO
- [x] add constraint bounds to ABC
- [x] write GA in oop
- [x] add GA to environment
- [x] implement gaussian ES
- [ ] implement CMA-ES 
- [x] implement differential evolution
- [ ] implement NES (optional)
- [x] add parallelisation to SA
- [x] add time functionality
- [x] Store solutions in CSV file for reproducibility

### After submission
- [x] Refactor main files into helper functions
- [x] Formalize readme document
- [ ] implement REINFORCE 
- [ ] implement Actor-Critic algorithm
